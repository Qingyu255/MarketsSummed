# MarketsSummed

Template Name: SB Admin 2 https://startbootstrap.com/theme/sb-admin-2

This website was created as a personal project to assist its users in getting a quick overview of the US stock market conditions.
This is done by helping to identify short-term bullish or bearish divergences in the stock market indicators through various means, such as using contrarian indicators.

This website's frontend is constructed using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap whilst the backend processes are built on Python
and the Flask framework. The charts were created using the Plotly library and the chart studio API.
